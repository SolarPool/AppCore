# About this repository

This repository acts as an up-to-date replica of Ciphernote's Client Application Core project. AppCore is platform agnostic and implements the entire business logic including but not limited to local note storage, crypto and cloud synchronization.

## Purpose

Please be aware that this repository exists soley for forensic purposes. The .net assemblies of the various Ciphernote Clients will never be obfuscated to make easy to verify that what's out in the wild matches the contents of this repository. 

This repository is neither intended to successfully build on its own nor to be a starting point for custom client implementations.
